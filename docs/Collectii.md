# Collectii

## 1. Product Overview

Collectii is a **workforce and team management platform** designed to help individuals, teams, and organizations execute work with clarity, accountability, and measurable performance. It focuses equally on **coordination (tasks, meetings, communication)** and **accountability (monitoring, scoring, analytics)**, positioning it beyond traditional task managers and CRMs.

Collectii is built as a **web-first platform**, with enterprise-grade security and a scalable architecture that supports individuals, organizations, and platform-wide administration.
